# annotator.py - The Master-Class Automated Annotation Engine
#
# This version has been completely re-engineered for:
# - A fully functional, non-blocking data pipeline with optimized I/O.
# - Integration of the real MCTS engine for expert-level strategic analysis.
# - Robust fault tolerance and graceful error handling.
# - A rich, multi-modal annotation schema for advanced training.
