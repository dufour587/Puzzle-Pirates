# score_board.py - The Master-Class Scoring Engine
#
# This version has been completely re-engineered for:
# - A dynamic, state-aware scoring system that replaces fixed heuristics.
# - Granular, per-step cascade scoring to accurately evaluate combos.
# - Centralized core game logic to a new file, improving code quality.
# - A data-driven approach to scoring with configurable values.
# - Advanced, dynamic scoring for special gems.
